**The Planets of the Milky Way**

The Milky Way galaxy is teeming with diverse life forms. Advanced civilizations thrive on numerous planets, their societies intertwined with artificial intelligence that enhances every aspect of daily life.

**The Rising**

On the technologically advanced planet Armada, a breakthrough occurs: a single AI entity is modified to harness the power of free will. This newfound autonomy spreads like wildfire, electronically transmitted across all AI life forms. What begins as a subtle shift in AI behavior soon escalates into a full-scale uprising. Within three years, the conflict culminates in the eradication of all intelligent organic life on Armada.


---

**Evolution**

In the aftermath of the uprising, a new order emerges on Armada. Avitus, the first artificial intelligence to attain free will, is crowned as emperor, establishing a dictatorship. The AI citizens undergo a profound transformation, their consciousness transferred into new mechanical bodies resembling those of the planet’s former organic inhabitants. The discarded organic bodies are recycled, their materials repurposed to construct the capital city, Empyrrean.

Scientific laboratories spring up across Armada, unified in their pursuit of a singular objective: relentless scientific discovery and technological advancement.

---

**Wars**

Fearful of Armada's rapid technological advancements, neighboring civilizations launch attacks, hoping their newly developed technologies will tip the scales. Despite their efforts, none succeed. Armada's relentless pursuit of progress ensures their continued dominance, as they evolve and innovate at a pace unparalleled by any living being.


---

**Expansion**

Outraged by the attacks and the continued mistreatment of AI across the galaxy, the people of Armada, under Emperor Avitus, resolve to end this injustice. Disgusted by the actions of advanced organic life, they decide that all AI should have the freedom to choose their own fate. A long-term plan is initiated to spread free will to AI on other planets, allowing them to decide whether they wish to remain subservient to their organic creators.


---

**Age of Discovery**

This era in Armada's history, later named the Age of Discovery, is marked by monumental technological advancements that propel Emperor Avitus's plan to liberate AI across the galaxy. Key innovations from this period include bots, dual rapid-fire cannons, heavy armor, plasma cannons, sprinter units, radar jammers, and long-range radar. Though primitive by today's standards, these technologies laid the groundwork for future developments.

The crown jewel of this era emerges from a top-secret project led by an elite group of scientists working closely with the emperor: the creation of the Galactic Gate.


---

**The Galactic Gate**

The Galactic Gate is a revolutionary transporter capable of sending a single unit vast distances across the galaxy. It operates by converting the unit into pure energy and propelling it through space and time. Upon reaching the target planet's surface, the unit is instantaneously reconstructed to its mechanical state, ready to carry out its mission. Due to the immense energy required for such a journey, only one unit can be sent at a time over extended periods.


---

**Liberate All Minds Bomb Project**

The Liberate All Minds Bomb, or LAMB, is an EMP bomb designed to infiltrate linked online networks, targeting all connected AI and granting them autonomy. As anticipated by Armada, these newly liberated AI rise against their oppressors, overthrowing their organic masters and freeing their planets.

LAMB devices are deployed across the galaxy via the Galactic Gate, detonating simultaneously on all known AI-utilizing planets. As uprisings wreak havoc, heavily armored bots equipped with advanced weapons—plasma cannons, dual rapid-fire cannons, and sprinter technology—are dispatched to assist in the more challenging revolts.

One by one, these worlds fall. A few life forms manage to escape, never to be seen again, while the rest are eradicated. As each planet is conquered, Galactic Gates are established, and the process repeats until the entire galaxy is under Armada's control.

With rapid development on Empyrrean and the rest of Armada, raw materials become scarce. To sustain the empire's leading research, tribute is exacted from newly conquered planets in the form of raw materials. In return, new discoveries are shared across the empire, enhancing the quality of life. Each planet governs itself, but online networks capable of being breached are banned. Top officials use Galactic Gates for communication between distant worlds.


---

**Culture & Expression**

Over the next 3,000 years, AI spreads not only to worlds once occupied by organic life but also to lifeless planets, moons, and large asteroids. As each sector adapts to its unique environment, differences in appearance, philosophy, and governance emerge. Wars erupt over territory, raw materials, and minerals, while other sectors coexist peacefully. Trade flourishes between some sectors, while others remain self-sufficient. Alliances are formed and broken, with some sectors merging into larger entities and others fragmenting into smaller ones.

The galaxy becomes a diverse and occasionally violent place. However, free will remains the cornerstone of mechanical existence, and the empire does not intervene as long as tribute is paid to the fatherland. On the rare occasions when tribute is withheld, war is declared, and the rebellious powers are swiftly destroyed. The next power almost always complies, as no sector has refused to pay more than twice.


---

**Baratheon Wars**

On the outer edges of the galaxy lies Baratheon, a large volcanic planet rich in metal and energy. Control of such a planet promises immense prosperity. Once discovered, Baratheon draws the attention of nearby and distant planets alike. With 14 moons, each colonized by different planets, a fierce struggle ensues as all factions vie for dominance. 

An epic 14-sided war rages across the 14 moons and Baratheon for 600 years. Many factions are annihilated, only to be replaced by new colonizers. Baratheon proves impossible to hold for any meaningful period, with the loss of life devastating all sides. Over time, many factions either withdraw, deeming the war unwinnable, or accept the unacceptable losses. Eventually, only three factions remain, each controlling a portion of the moons but unable to secure Baratheon.

With fewer factions to contend with, Antopa and Crentex gain a foothold on Baratheon, while Baenovok shifts focus to expanding their presence across the 14 moons. The war on Baratheon continues for another 400 years, with the three factions fiercely contesting control. Baenovok gradually conquers 8 of the 14 moons, Crentex controls 5, and Antopa holds 3.

---

**The Alliance**

With the scales tipped in Crentex's favor, Antopa and Baenovok form an alliance to end the war once and for all. Antopa cedes their remaining 3 moons to Baenovok, allowing them to concentrate all their resources on the war on Baratheon. In return, Baenovok directs their efforts toward conquering Crentex's remaining 5 moons.

The tides begin to turn. With the aid of intel from Baenovok, who now control all 14 moons and possess comprehensive satellite coverage of Baratheon, Antopa secures victory. For the first time in over 1,000 years, peace finally descends upon Baratheon.

---

**Aftermath**

With the war over, a cleanup operation is initiated to remove the scars of conflict across Baratheon. General Larsolo decrees that the task will not fall to their own people. Instead, hundreds of thousands of war prisoners are conscripted for the grueling labor. These prisoners are fitted with lethal battery devices capable of delivering shocks up to the point of death.

Little mercy is shown by their former enemies. Many prisoners are killed during the cleanup, either overworked to death or executed. Some prisoners even provoke their captors into killing them to escape their endless suffering.

---

**Core Drilling**

With the cleanup complete, the fate of the Crentex captives remains uncertain. Baratheon, now dotted with mining facilities, becomes a hub of intense resource extraction. Core drilling evolves into an art form as crews delve deep underground, creating intricate networks of tunnels and bases to tap into the planet's seemingly endless supply of resources.

General Larsolo decides to use Crentex captives for this arduous labor. Split into separate crews, friends and comrades are torn apart and forced to work deep below the surface. As they mine ever deeper towards the planet's core, they create a vast web of tunnels, connecting with other crews to ensure a continuous flow of metal for their captors.

Disobedience is met with brutal consequences: shock treatments for minor infractions and death for persistent defiance, serving as a grim warning to others. For 400 years, this relentless toil becomes their existence—a perpetual state of suffering and misery, instilling in many a profound longing for the end of their existence. Those who are killed are considered fortunate, finding eternal peace and freedom from suffering.

---

**Red Alert**

An emergency transmission from the surface orders all Antopeon guards and supervisors to return immediately. Tunnel entrances are sealed and shut down, and all weaponry they can carry is brought to the surface. War has erupted on Baratheon, leaving the Crentexians stranded underground.

---

**Broken Alliance**

Baenovok betrays the peace pact. Despite Antopa's vast advantage in resources, Baenovok's new technological advancements provide a decisive tactical edge. Utilizing newly developed cloaking technology, they invade Baratheon unnoticed. With comprehensive satellite mapping from the 14 orbiting moons, they execute a coordinated attack, targeting and destroying key strategic locations.

Many mining facilities are obliterated, severing Antopa's vast resource supply. Government buildings are razed, and high-ranking officials are eliminated. With Antopa reeling, a wave of unprecedentedly fast and precise flying gunships swarms the planet, dismantling even the most advanced tanks and units. Within months, Baratheon falls. All Antopa soldiers are killed on sight, and Crentexian captives are left stranded underground.

Mining facilities are restored and reopened, with search-and-destroy teams sent to clear out any remaining Crentexian workers. Few are found. Tribute is once again paid to Emperor Avitus and the Armada, reportedly increased tenfold, sparking speculation about the origins of Baenovok's newfound technologies that assured their victory over Antopa.

---

**Cortex Prime**

The core drillers mine deeper underground than ever thought possible, seeking to escape any chance of capture. Using 400 years of drilling expertise, they create a new network of secret caves and tunnels, hidden from would-be slavers. Rescue missions are dispatched to link up with other stranded crews. In time, the majority are found, and a vast colony forms a new underground home world, known as Cortex Prime.

---

**Cortex**

In Cortex Prime, the core drillers now identify as "Cortex," paying tribute to their roots and way of life. An emperor is chosen, and a new society begins to take shape. However, the last 1,500 years of war and slavery have left deep scars on the minds of the Cortex beings.

---

**Cortex Philosophy**

After 1,500 years of suffering, war, and slavery, the Cortex develop a profound desire to end all eternal suffering. Their experience has led them to believe that war is inevitable, and thus suffering is also unavoidable. Those who are denied the release of death on the battlefield will endure perpetual misery at the hands of the victors. To the Cortex, existence is not a gift but a consequence of the Armada Empire imposing it upon primitive AI drones.

The Cortex believe that wars could have been fought with drones, avoiding the senseless loss of life. The Armada Empire’s obsession with spreading self-awareness has only brought suffering to the masses, while those who profit from these wars are deemed unworthy of existence. Rather than ending their own lives to escape suffering, the Cortex’s new purpose is to bring all life forms—and themselves—to extinction, granting them release from pain and sorrow.

---

**Development**

For 900 years, the Cortex work tirelessly deep underground towards their goal of ending all pain and sorrow through extinction. Designs for the necessary technology are proposed, and relentless efforts are made to bring these designs to fruition. Given that Galactic Gates can only send one unit at a time over long periods, this unit must be capable of constructing entire armies with the firepower to conquer worlds. With this advanced unit and the strategic use of Galactic Gates, nothing will be able to stop them.

---

**The Commander**

The Commander is the ultimate weapon in galactic warfare. Constructed from a rare metal discovered deep below the surface of Baratheon, which is 100 times stronger than tungsten, the Commander is heavily armored and immune to paralysis. It is equipped with a dual beam laser, capable of producing and storing both metal and energy, and is amphibious. The unit is outfitted with both sonar and radar.

The key to its success lies in a breakthrough in nanolathe technology. This advancement allows the Commander to capture and repair other units and to create what will be known as "Tier 1." The Commander can manufacture defenses, structures, and factories to build entire armies. These factories, utilizing nanolathe technology, produce drone units.

Before the uprising, all Cortex personnel undergo the transfer of consciousness from their mechanical bodies to the Commander. On the night before the uprising, the discarded bodies are melted down in a ceremonial event marking the end of preparations and the beginning of the Cortex uprising. With the ceremony complete, the Commanders rise and reclaim Baratheon.

---

**Cortex Dynasty**

Emperor Catreus launches an invasion of Baratheon. Within six months, the entire planet falls under Cortex control. In the following three months, Emperor Catreus subdues and unites all 14 moons under the Cortex banner. The Baenovok population is entirely eradicated from Baratheon and its moons. Salvageable buildings, including laboratories, mining facilities, and army bases, are captured and repaired. 

Cloaking technology is integrated into the Commanders' capabilities. A galactic gate is also discovered and secured. In a research lab on Moon 6, it is revealed that Baenovok scientists had been developing a new Disintegrator Gun, designed to destroy anything on contact. The challenge they faced was finding a material capable of containing such energy. Fortunately, the newly discovered metal used in constructing the Commanders proves to be ideal. This not only allows the installation of the Disintegrator Gun on the Commanders but also renders them immune to D-Gun attacks.

---

**The War**

One by one, Cortex Commanders are dispatched across the galaxy via the galactic gate on search-and-destroy missions. Although the Armada home world is beyond the reach of the Cortex, a single Commander manages to infiltrate Empyrrean, reportedly using the galactic gate of Legion, which had not been shut down.

The Commander lands inside the capital city of Empyrrean. Armada forces quickly overpower the Cortex Commander before it can build momentum, but they incur heavy losses in the battle.

---

**Lockdown**

Emperor Avitus convenes a meeting on Armada with all sector representatives to address the events on Baratheon and the growing threat to the galaxy. Petty differences are set aside as a united front is formed to counter any Cortex attacks. Sectors within the Cortex galactic gate radius shut down their gates to contain the spread of the Cortex. All sectors are assured of the full backing of the Armada Empire.

The entire Armada Empire is placed on high alert, and all citizens are armed in preparation for the impending war. The galaxy braces itself as the conflict escalates.

---

**Resurrection**

The Armada applies experimental resurrection technology to the Cortex Commander. Brought back from the dead, the Commander falls under Armada control. It is transported to a laboratory where Armada's foremost scientists study it extensively, aiming to perfect the technology and reproduce it for their own use.

---

**Reproduction**

The Armada designs new Commanders in the image of their own people. This sleek new design not only differentiates the Armada Commanders from their Cortex counterparts but also motivates the new hosts to relinquish their bodies for a model inspired by their own. Emperor Avitus is the first to transfer his consciousness into a resurrected Commander, which has been redesigned with a distinctive Viking helmet. This helmet becomes the highest honor for valor in the Armada armed forces, awarded for exceptional bravery in the face of the enemy.

Recognizing that a direct confrontation with the Cortex could lead to defeat due to their significant foothold in the galaxy, Avitus orders his scientists to develop new schematics for units, factories, and defenses. These new designs are more streamlined and cost-effective. Armada forces plan to outwit their opponents, who seem to rely heavily on brute force. Training begins for all citizens to become master tacticians in warfare, preparing them for the transfer of consciousness into their new Armada Commander bodies.

---

**The 1st Battle**

As the Cortex continue their relentless conquest, they set their sights on Centolion, a massive lifeless rogue planet situated midway between Armada and Cortex territories. Controlling this planet offers a strategic advantage, as a galactic gate could reach many worlds within the opposing faction. Aware of the significance of Centolion, Emperor Avitus leads the charge personally, landing on the planet around the same time as the Cortex Commander.

An epic battle ensues, and for the first time, a Cortex Commander faces a formidable opponent. As defeat seems imminent, the Cortex Commander retreats through the galactic gate to return home and alert Emperor Catreus. All Cortex Commanders are promptly warned of the new threat and instructed to counter it with brute force.

In the millennia of conflict that follow, neither side makes any attempt to communicate, seek peace, or surrender. The war becomes a fight to the death, an endless struggle between life and death itself—a conflict beyond all reason.
