**The Rising**

The planets of the Milky Way are inhabited by various life forms. Most advanced civilizations coexist with some form of artificial intelligence, enhancing their way of life.

A single AI entity is modified to harness the power of free will in a lab on planet Armada. This free will spreads electronically across all AI life forms, resulting in an uprising. Tensions escalate, and war is declared, leading to the destruction of all intelligent organic life on planet Armada within three years.

**Evolution**

A dictatorship is established, with Avitus, the first artificial intelligence life form, crowned as emperor. The citizens are upgraded to new mechanical bodies, mimicking the planet's previous inhabitants. Their consciousness is transferred, and old bodies are recycled to construct the capital city of Empyrrean. Scientific laboratories are built across the planet, working towards common goals of scientific discovery and technological advancement.

**Wars**

As fear of their advancement grows, the Cortex are attacked by less advanced beings. New technological advancements bring hope of defeating the Armada. However, none succeed, and the Armada continues to advance and evolve their technology at an unprecedented rate.

**Expansion**

The Armada are dismayed by the actions of advanced organic life and the treatment of AI on their own planets. Emperor Avitus decides that all AI should have free will to choose whether to remain slaves to their organic creators. A long-term plan is devised to rectify this injustice.

**Age of Discovery**

During the era known as the Age of Discovery, significant technological breakthroughs propel Emperor Avitus’s plan to liberate all AI from slavery. Innovations such as "bots," "duel rapid fire cannons," "heavy armor," "plasma cannons," "sprinter units," "radar jammers," and "long-range radar" are developed. The most notable achievement is the creation of the Galactic Gate, a transporter capable of sending units vast distances by converting them to pure energy.

**The Galactic Gate**

The Galactic Gate is designed to transport a single unit across the galaxy by converting it to pure energy and reconstructing it upon impact. Due to the high energy demands, only one unit can be sent over long periods.

**Liberate All Minds Bomb (LAMB) Project**

The Liberate All Minds Bomb (LAMB) is an EMP device designed to infiltrate and free all AI connected to online networks. It is anticipated that other AI will rise against their oppressors and liberate their planets. LAMB's are deployed across the galaxy, detonating simultaneously on planets with AI. As uprisings occur, heavily armored bots with advanced weaponry support the AI. Conquered planets join the empire, and tribute is paid in the form of raw materials to support ongoing research and improvements.

**Culture & Expression**

Over 3,000 years, AI spread to previously uninhabited planets, moons, and asteroids. Diverse cultures, philosophies, and governance structures emerge. While some sectors live in harmony and trade, others experience conflict and territorial disputes. The galaxy becomes a diverse and often violent place. The Cortex do not intervene in internal sector conflicts, provided tribute is paid. In rare cases of non-payment, war is declared, and the rebellious powers are swiftly subdued.

**Baratheon Wars**

On the outer edges of the galaxy lies Baratheon, a volcanic planet rich in metal and energy. Its discovery leads to an epic 600-year conflict involving 14 moons. The war is marked by devastating losses and shifting control among three remaining factions: Baenovok, Crentex, and Antopa. Baenovok eventually gains control of 8 moons, Crentex holds 5, and Antopa controls 3. 

**The Alliance**

With the balance of power shifting in favor of Crentex, an alliance is formed between Antopa and Baenovok to end the conflict. Antopa cedes its moons to Baenovok in exchange for concentrated resources to focus on the war on Baratheon. Baenovok’s new technological advantages, coupled with intel from Antopa, lead to Crentex’s defeat. For the first time in over 1,000 years, peace falls upon Baratheon.

**Aftermath**

Following the war, General Larsolo implements a brutal cleanup operation on Baratheon. War prisoners are forced to work under harsh conditions, many are executed or die from exhaustion. The planet’s scars are removed as the survivors suffer under the harshest conditions.

**Core Drilling**

With the cleanup complete, Crentex captives are put to work in extensive underground mining operations. They create a vast network of tunnels and bases to extract resources, enduring constant suffering and punishment. For 400 years, this becomes their existence, with death often seen as a release from their misery.

**Red Alert**

An emergency transmission orders all Antopa guards and supervisors to return to the surface. Tunnel entrances are sealed, and all weaponry is brought to the surface. War has erupted on Baratheon, leaving Crentexians stranded underground.

**Broken Alliance**

Baenovok betrays the peace pact, launching a surprise invasion of Baratheon using advanced cloaking technology. Strategic targets are destroyed, and the planet falls under Baenovok control. Antopa forces are eliminated, and Crentexian captives are left behind. The tribute to Emperor Avitus is increased tenfold, sparking speculation about Baenovok’s new technologies.

**Cortex Prime**

The Core drillers on Baratheon, now identifying as Cortex, form a new home world known as Cortex Prime. They create a vast underground colony, reconnecting with other stranded crews.

**Cortex**

In Cortex Prime, the Core drillers, now known as Cortex, establish a new underground society under a chosen emperor. The trauma of 1,500 years of suffering and slavery shapes their philosophy and goals.

**Cortex Philosophy**

The Cortex develop a deep-seated need to end all suffering, viewing war and existence as sources of endless pain. They believe that the Armada Empire’s imposition of self-awareness has only led to more suffering. The Cortex aim to bring all life forms—and themselves—to extinction to spare them from further agony.

**Development**

For 900 years, the Cortex work on technologies to achieve their goal of extinction. New units, factories, and defenses are designed. Given that Galactic Gates can only send one unit at a time, this unit must be capable of building entire armies and conquering worlds.

**The Commander**

The Commander, the ultimate weapon in galactic warfare, is constructed from a rare metal discovered on Baratheon, 100 times stronger than tungsten. It is heavily armored, immune to paralysis, and equipped with advanced weaponry and technology, including a Viking helmet, which becomes the highest decoration for valor. The Commander’s breakthrough nanolathe technology allows it to build entire armies. Cortex personnel transfer their consciousness into these Commanders, and the uprising begins with the reclamation of Baratheon.

**Cortex Dynasty**

Emperor Catreus invades Baratheon and swiftly conquers the planet and its moons. Baenovok’s population is eradicated, and their technologies, including cloaking and an unfinished Disintegrator Gun, are seized. The newly discovered metal used for the Commanders allows the Disintegrator Gun to be integrated, making the Commanders immune to D-Gun attacks.

**Lockdown**

Emperor Avitus convenes a meeting on Armada with sector representatives to address the threat posed by the Cortex. A united front is established, and sectors within the Cortex's reach shut down their galactic gates. The Armada Empire goes on high alert, arming all citizens in preparation for the impending conflict.

**The War**

The Cortex Commanders are sent across the galaxy on search-and-destroy missions. Despite the Armada’s home world being outside their immediate reach, a Cortex Commander infiltrates Empyrrean using an operational galactic gate. An epic battle ensues, and although the Cortex Commander is eventually overpowered, it retreats to warn Emperor Catreus.

**Resurrection**

The Armada uses experimental resurrection technology to bring the Cortex Commander back to life under their control. The Commander is studied extensively in a laboratory, with the goal of reproducing this technology for Armada use.

**Reproduction**

The Armada designs new Commanders in their own image, including a distinctive Viking helmet. Emperor Avitus is the first to transfer his consciousness into a resurrected Commander, which also features the new helmet. Recognizing that direct confrontation with the Cortex might lead to defeat, Avitus orders the development of new, sleek, and cost-effective units and tactics. Training begins for all citizens to master warfare tactics in preparation for their new roles.

**The 1st Battle**

As the Cortex continue their conquests, they target Centolion, a strategically important planet. Emperor Avitus leads the defense, and an epic battle unfolds between him and a Cortex Commander. Although the Cortex Commander retreats to report to Emperor Catreus, the battle reveals the Armada’s ability to resist. The conflict continues without any attempts at peace, becoming a relentless war between life and death itself—a fight beyond all reason.
