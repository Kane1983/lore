## Overview
This is a storage for everything non-game about the lore, backstory, campaign(s) and possible other meta information about the game.

### Contributing
Campaign stories and lore are something which attracts a lot of armchair contributors. People who say "it should be this way" without spending time working with the team or considering the full implications. As such we'll be a little stricter about giving write permissions to this repo than we would others and the PRs may be more scrutinised.

All documentation files should be in Markdown, not word docs, google docs or plaintext files. While we don't enforce a specific formatting within those files they do need to be consistent. If you are editing an existing file your edits need to conform to that file and if you are creating a separate contribution (e.g. your own campaign suggestion) it needs to be consistent within itself.

### Sections of lore
Backstory sets the context for everything else to live in. We have set out the foundations of it and currently have no plans to change them. If someone has a superb idea we would of course reconsider.

Campaigns at this stage are plans/ideas for campaigns we can use. People are welcome to create their own campaign by making a folder within the campaign section. If you are creating your own campaign then PRs will be approved much more readily. If you want to contribute to someone else's then they will need to approve it before the PR is accepted.

Characters listed within the lore section are part of the backstory, you are not obliged to use these characters (in fact it'll likely be more interesting for you and players if you create your own) though there are themes for each race you are expected to conform to.
