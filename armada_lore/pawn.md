# Teifion's suggestion
Created by Aurelius during a multi-stage campaign across the Sythicar system. The system was full of large asteroids, each becoming a new battleground and preventing Aurelius from amassing his forces in one place. As a result the Personified attack warrior node (Pawn) was created.

Initially designed to be cheap, expendable but also pack a punch the Pawn delivered magnificently. It was able to hold its own in small engagements and against larger foes it was able to surround and overcome even the biggest Cortex units.

By the time the Sythicar campaign was in the final stages the Cortex had built up and fortified the largest of the planets in the system. Using waves and waves of Pawns Aurelius was able to overwhelm the elite guard of the Cortex commander and seize victory. Since then the Pawn has been a staple of Armada forces, often being the first combat unit deployed against their foes.
