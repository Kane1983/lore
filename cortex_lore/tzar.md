Having been defeated on the battleground of Norgvun by a combination of Pawn waves combined with Bull tanks; Alecto sought a method to defeat such forces. In addition to finding such a method, she was fortunate to create it against her nemesis Remus. As their forces clashed on the open lands of Tzagnath, territory well suited to the Pawn and Bull combination, Alecto unleashed a division of monstrous tanks.

These tanks obliterated the pawns and simple out-gunned and out-armoured the Bulls. By the time Remus realised what had happened it was too late. He was forced to flee lest he too be destroyed. In homage to the battle where they demonstrated their worth, Alecto named them Tzar, king of the tanks.
