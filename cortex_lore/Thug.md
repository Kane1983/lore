Commander Hercules was tasked with taking and holding a territory rich in metal resources, aptly named the Serendipity System. Unfortunately, its core resource cluster was located in winding crags held by Commander Marcella of the Armada. She was holding the territory with the newly minted Pawn units, which proved capable of quickly navigating mapped flanking routes in the crags.

Hercules needed a combined arms option that didn't involve throwing his forces away to such an aggressive defense. He worked up plans for a cheap and expendable heavy hitter that could work in tandem with a screening force of Grunts. Thus the Thug was born. Equipped with hard hitting dual plasmas, the Thugs could be built in such numbers that they would overwhelm static defense chokepoints with their combined heavy firepower, while pawns caught in front of their advance were quickly dismantled under their walls of plasma fire. With Grunts serving to cover their flanks, the combination of their range, superior to Pawns, with the plasma cannons of the Thugs, were a nigh unstoppable tide. Caught off guard by the brutal offensive, Marcella was forced to retreat, lest she be swept away as well.
