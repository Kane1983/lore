# LockeEdwards' suggestion
Norgvun proved to be one of the most open battlefields so far to date.  Alecto, seeking to take and hold the region before her adversaries, was tasked with rapidly scouting, taking, and holding the territory.  Enter the Grunt, so named for its role as a well-rounded backbone unit for light engagements and swarm tactics. It was cheap, had a remarkable range for its class and size, and maneuverable to a frightening degree.

Alecto was able to utilize this desceptively light unit to devastating effect in the early engagements on Norgvun, rapidly surrounding and overpowering static emplacements and many of Armada's slower tanks. Before long, she was able to replace every lost Grunt with another two or three, granting her a numbers advantage against an ill prepared Armada front.
