#### Overarching ideas for an engaging campaign:

 - Story driven. A compelling unravelling story that engages the player(s) and draws them in, pulling their curiosity into wanting to know more about it. A story good enough to be told seperately from the game itself.
 - A living environment that moves. Things happening, moving, not just a static board that awaits for the player(s).
 - Mission control. In between missions, an environment that shows the campaign progress, with impactful choices. Could be choosing between mission priorities, could be choosing/purchasing starting units or commander upgrades.
 - Difficult choices that players have to make that impacts the story and possibly the ending.
 - Incredibly varied missions using every tool BAR has. Control points, capture mechanic, scavs/raptors, tower defence, race, eco-mode, limited resources mode,...
 - Asymmetric co-op. Co-op where each participant has a different role that must work together to achieve the common goal.
 - Very wide difficulty settings. From 'story' mode where almost anyone could easily finish the campaign without much skill at all, to extreme mode where you need to be pro and use everything in the book with many retries to finish the campaign.
