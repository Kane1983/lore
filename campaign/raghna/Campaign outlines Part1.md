### 1. Intro: Four commanders and a lost colony

_You, an experienced commander, have been assigned to an Executional Officer's rescue mission. Making you the newest addition to the infamous Exocom's ranks. With the rank comes perks: a highly advanced multipurpose mechincal suit of your choosing built by one of the two Exo's approved elite manufacturers: Armada and Cortex. Your interstellar destination? A fledgling colony, set up by Commanders much as yourselves, under threat._

_Shortly after the settling Commanders arrived in the promising new star system, on the outer edges of the ever expanding empire, all quantum communications with the colony suddenly broke down. Their initial goal was to construct a standard galactic gateway which would allow instantaneous travel and connection to the rest of the empire. Since then, there has been no news, no information on the fate of the expedition and most importantly, no signal of a newly built gateway._

_This is where you come in, Commander. Hurling through space using conventional slowtravel, with nothing but your very own Exocom, a highly advanced multipurpose mechanical suit. You are the second wave expeditionary force. Your objective is to reestablish communication with HQ, survey the land, and assemble the galactic gateway. Identifying the cause of failure and current status of the first Commanders could be key to ensuring the success of the mission, however is absolutely secondary to the completion of the gateway._

_Oh and one more thing Commander. Since slowtravel is... well, slow, 117 years will have passed between the breakdown in communication, and your arrival in the star system. Who knows what will have happened between the two. We are therefor equipping each of your Exocoms with full offensive capabilities as well as military construction options that can be activated if the need would arise._

_Commander, good luck._
_HQ, over and out._
## 2. Campaign Characteristics
### 2.1. Big Bad Who?

During the campaign, the players will face several antagonists that will serve as obstacles for the player to achieve their goal. At the start of every campaign, one of these antagonists will be randomly picked to represent the main threat for the expedition. While most of the campaign will remain unchanged, a few clues, a few significant differences and then the ultimate end-goal of the campaign will be different, leaving options open for the player(s) to pick up on the different story elements to (mis)guide their expedition.

As the expedition arrives in the star system, they are set to explore, investigate and discover the several planets. They can choose their priorities and the order in which they complete each new path forward. As they gather clues as to what happened, they are presented with multiple scenarios. Depending on the order in which they complete these, the difficulty or even availability of each can change. Wider impact on the story and options are also affected by the choices made by the players, both in each scenario as well as in between. Ultimately, during the playthrough, the player(s) must pick up on clues left to identify the threat and eventually choose for one of the several goals which will appropriately deal with the threat facing their particular campaign.
### 2.2. Co-op or not

 - 1-4 players
 - 2 player co-op as how it’s meant to be played™
 - 3-4 players simply adds more players and difficulty
 - 1 player campaigns will have AI ally that can be coordinated with using triggers

Multiplayer focused missions would vary, from the players each having different limitations (units/resources/...) that need to be overcome by their ally in a fully cooperative two-step, or missions such as one side having to hold out until their ally can get through from the other side and perform a rescue.
### 2.3. Independent Campaign

The campaign is designed in such a way as to be its own story telling strategic campaign in every sense of the word. 

 - not a tutorial for multiplayer
 - not a simple series of loosely held together missions
 - not just some dry text in between missions

It’s a story as a whole first and foremost, that uses the game to give agency and therefor full immersion into the depth of the story. The player is presented with meaningful choices that affect not only the gameplay elements, but also the outcome of the story itself. 
### 2.4. Difficulties:

 - Story mode is a casual experience with little to no difficulty. The story carries the game here.
 - Normal, as it’s meant to be played™
 - Hardcore is a near-impossible challenge for high-scoring completionists and their friends

## 3. Campaign
### 3.1 Chapter I
#### 3.1.1. Start
During the Campaign setup, each player chooses their colour and Armada/Cortex faction.
The host determines the amount of available slots and can invite friends to join.
Once everybody is ready, the host can press start.

We begin with a short narrated intro, accompanied by commissioned artwork in a similar style of something like Divinity Original Sin 2's intro.
This sets the tone and introduces the setting to the player.

#### 3.1.2. Hot Landing


A loading screen shows us how the players arrive at the end of their long space travel to land in this alien star system, at the very same site as the initial settling Commanders.

The players arrive spread out on the low ground of Hotstepper, surrounded by wrecks. What looks like destroyed bases everywhere might be cause for concern, but the initial mission objective is clear: build up a T2 Quantum Communicator to contact HQ and report.

We're reminded that all combat abilities and military production is locked behind explicit HQ approval.
As soon as a radar is built, it picks up a large wave of heat signatures advancing rapidly on this position.
Without enough time to build the Quantum Communicator, laying in a sea of wrecks, and no way to defend oneself, the mission is off to a dangerous start.

Not long after, the heat signature turns out to be none other than a tidal wave of lava rising up.
A rush to the middle of the map, to escape impending doom, brings the players to the centre of the map, on top of the hill.

Here we discover an abandoned base, seemingly built by the first expedition.
After capturing the airlab, we find travel logs indicating exactly where they initially departed to.
Quickly building transports allows us to escape this hellscape, already on our way to our next destination.

#### 3.1.3. Capture The Fly

The trajectory our squad is following has taken them right over what looks like a permanent volcano. When the loading screen completes, every player has the option to ready up, after which they find themselves on Forge v1.4 flying in uncontrollable transports over the map, until they fly into AA turrets. Without any warning they are shot down and the transports barely have time to make an emergency landing before they are destroyed.

What are these doing here? Why are they set to fire at will? Something is amiss.
To make matters worse, without contact with HQ, all weaponry is still disabled. You start questioning HQ's judgement. No wonder the first expedition had trouble. We still don't have any update if anything happened since we left, 117 years ago.

Good thing these turrets can't shoot ground, we're defenseless.
Perhaps we can capture military equipment to make use of it ourselves. Lets start with the radar facility here.

Meanwhile, as the lava on the low ground rises and lowers, we note how this is definitely not the right place to build a base, and buildoptions are disabled.

As the low ground is regularly flooded, we can't walk over to the other side to continue our journey.
Walking closer to the edge of the canyon, as our radar indicates, there's more enemies. More AA turrets, and patrolling fighter planes above. Hmm, suspicious. Does anyone know we'd fly here?

Either way, if we capture the AA turrets here, they'll shoot down the fighters and clear our path.
We're also finding a small base with an aircraft plant and some resource facilities.
Here we can rebuild our transports to continue our journey.

Alternatively, if we went towards the centre of our high ground side, we find another aircraft plant that allows us to build fighters and transports so we can fly over the centre of the map.

Once on the other side, we're stopped by more AA turrets, but this time protected by LLT's.
A bot lab and a few rocket bots in front of them are an alluring target to capture and use against the defences though.
Whoever built this doesn't seem to be around to respond to us. Where could they be?

Having succesfully dealt with the last line of defences, we're free to fly off and continue our journey.

### 3.1.4. Contact and Contact
Arriving in Centerrock Remake Dry 1.2, we're fast approaching our waypoint. The transport drops us off in the middle, exactly where the first expedition flew to 117 years ago. Surely, if HQ had already reestablished contact with them, someone would at least be welcoming us here, right? Seems like we can scratch "best case scenario" off the list. Lets hope what we encountered earlier wasn't a welcoming party meant for us.

Hmm. Here we are. Nothing.
What a quick end to our trail of crumbs.

While we search for any clues in the surrounding area, we might as well set up base here.
Actually, perhaps we should focus on finally building a Quantum Communicator. We have a lot of pressing questions for HQ.

Still with all weapons off limit, the player is free to build up their base. They have as objective to build a large expensive T2 building, the Quantum Communicator. In the meanwhile, several sites around the map can be explored in search of clues as to the whereabouts of the first expedition.
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/Mkoeb0O.png)
As soon the Quantum Communicator is beginning construction, any radar will pick up an incoming force. It bears the same signal as the forces by the volcano. Unfriendly then.

It's a race to finish the device, to be able to contact HQ and enable our weapons, or we're helpless against any offensive.
As soon as the device is finished, and has its high energy consumption's demand satisfied, a quick verification and virtual handshake takes place as a baseline for communication with HQ and the Executional Office.

Our initial request to activate combat abilities are immediately denied and followed by a strong denial: "the sector you've been assigned to, has no signs of any hostile environment, standard procedure forbids any change in protocol". Even our data on our encounter is simply dismissed as 'probable malfunctions'.

No amount of outrage seems to provide any change in HQ's tone. Only when the scouts of the approaching party makes it to our base and start firing, does HQ finally sends us emergency unlocking codes. Our Exocoms lasers, and standard all-purpose weaponized units are finally enabled as building options. (Pawns, Grunts, Incisor, Blitz, fighters)

Once the attacking force has finally been dealt with we can refocus our attention to the million and one questions we have burning for HQ.

### 3.1.5. Long distance update

Our enthousiasm dies down as our debriefing and update on current events is remarkably short.
The countless questions we have are either barely acknowledged or outright denied under the guise of "altered circumstances". We are told our priority above all remains to find a proper site, assemble enough materials and complete the construction of the gateway. Any potential threat to the completion of the gateway should immediately be identified, however, despite our earlier encounter, HQ still doesn't foresee much if any hostile activity.

No further weaponry unlock codes have been sent, but we're promised new codes if any threat levels seem to increase.
Why is HQ so difficult with weapon unlocks? What are they not telling us?

HQ urges us to focus on the task at hand, to keep them regularly updated, and to let HQ ask the questions.

### 3.1.6. Opening move

After the abrasive communication from HQ, we're back with our mission in front of us. Where to start?
Now that our base is set up, we are ready to venture forth. Several potential destinations have been mapped out.
